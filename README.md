### What is PVE Kernel Cleaner?

PVE Kernel Cleaner is a program to compliment Proxmox Virtual Environment which is an open-source server virtualization environment. PVE Kernel Cleaner allows you to purge old/unused kernels filling the /boot directory. As new kernels are released the older ones have to be manually removed frequently to make room for newer ones. This can become quite tedious and require extensive time spent monitoring the system when new kernels are released and when older ones need to be cleared out to make room. With this issue existing, PVE Kernel Cleaner was created to solve it.

```

## Usage Examples:
Here are some common ways to use PVE Kernel Cleaner:

* **Remove Old Kernels Non-Interactively:**
```bash
pvekclean -f
```
<sub> This command removes old PVE kernels without requiring user confirmation.</sub>

* **Set Number of Kernels to Keep:**
```bash
pvekclean -k 3
```
<sub>This command specifies the number of most recent PVE kernels to keep on the system.</sub>

* **Force Remove Old Kernels While Keeping a Certain Number:**
```bash
pvekclean -f -k 3
```
<sub>This command forces the removal of old PVE kernels while retaining a specific number of the most recent ones.</sub>

* **Remove Newer Kernels and Keep a Specific Number:**
```bash
pvekclean -rn -k 2
```
<sub>This command removes newer PVE kernels and keeps a specified number of the most recent ones.</sub>

* **Schedule Regular Kernel Removal:**
```bash
pvekclean -s
```
<sub>This command sets up PVE Kernel Cleaner to remove old PVE kernels on a scheduled basis. You can configure the schedule according to your needs.</sub>

* **Perform a Dry Run without Making Changes:**
```bash
pvekclean -d
```
<sub>This command runs PVE Kernel Cleaner in dry run mode, simulating actions without actually removing any kernels or making changes to your system. It's useful for testing and understanding what the script would do.</sub>
